# Advent of Code 2021
Was a really challenging but fun year! I was able to consistently finish each problem in the day each problem came out till about Day 18 after which it would take me much, much longer to finish each problem. Day 19 was the perhaps the most challenging for me and all I can say is that working with 3D space is really not my strong point (Further proven by Day 22 which I found to be the second hardest challenge, my *reaction* you could say was not too good when I read it :) )

The solutions get pretty rough (rougher than they already are) towards the end so proceed with caution.

Can't wait for next year!
